 # Challenge Summary

>SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks, and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).


```
class SetOfStacks {
  constructor(private readonly maxHeight: number) {}
  
  push(t: T): void;
  pop(): T;
  get peek(): T;
}
```
