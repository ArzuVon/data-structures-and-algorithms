# Data Structures & Algorithms, Career Coaching

## Learning Objectives

### Data Structure: Stacks & Queues

Arrays allow quick random access. Linked Lists enforce first/next. Stacks and
Queues encode traversal and structure together.

- Stacks: Last In (push), First Out (pop) (peek)
- Queues: First In (enqueue), First Out, (dequeue) (peek)
- JS Array: push, pop, shift, unshift, [0], [length - 1]
