# Maze Roooms for Videogame Company

## Graph

>We work for a video game company, and they have an algorithm that generates mazes for players to solve. The mazes are rooms connected by doors. Some of the doors might be locked with a key of some color, and some rooms have a key in them. But it doesnâ€™t always generate a maze that can be solved!

### Write a function, `can_solve`, which takes a maze as its input and returns boolean `true` if a player could get from the start of the maze to the pot of gold, or false if there is a locked door without an available key between the start and the gold
