# Trees

Trees are one of the most commonly used data structures and every developer who has written HTML and loaded it into a web browser has created a tree. The HTML tree is also known as the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Challenge

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

- Create a Binary Tree class
- Create a Binary Search Tree class

>Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

## Approach & Efficiency

```

>Pre-order: root >> left >> right
In-order: left >> root >> right
Post-order: left >> right >> root
Finding the max

```
