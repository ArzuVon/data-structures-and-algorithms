# Trees

Trees are one of the most commonly used data structures and every developer who has written HTML and loaded it into a web browser has created a tree. The HTML tree is also known as the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Challenge

>Pre-order: root >> left >> right
In-order: left >> root >> right
Post-order: left >> right >> root

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.
