### Key Notes

- LL: Nodes have a single "next" edge. No cycles.
- Trees: Have 2 to N "left/right" or "child" edges. No cycles.
- Cycle: When an edge points to its parent or anything that would point to it.
- Graphs: Nodes have edges. (No constraints.)
- Nodes (vertices / vertex): "things" in our problem space.
- Edge (links, adjacencies): "relationship" between things.
- Neighbors: Adjacent nodes, any pair of nodes connected by an edge.
- Degrees: Least number of edges between two nodes.
- Connected graph: Any node has a path to any other node.
- Path: Any set of edges from one node to another.
- Directed graph: Edges have a "direction"
- Undirecteed graph: Edges have no direction*
