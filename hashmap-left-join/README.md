# Hashmap LEFT JOIN

- Joins two hashmaps into a single data structure

## Challenge

> Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.
> The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
> The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
> Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic

### Approach & Efficiency

- create a results array
- loop through leftMap and push all key/value pairs as a nested array to our results array
- loop through results array
  - check if rightMap has the key/string at index 0 of the nested array at the current i index => `results[i][0]`
  - If key exists, retrieve the value and push it to nested array at the current i index
  - If key does not exist, push null to the nested array at the current i index
- return the results matrix

### Big O

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

### API

- leftJoin(leftMap, rightMap, string)
  - Arguments: two hash maps and optional string of 'right' to perform
