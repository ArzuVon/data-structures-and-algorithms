---

- Write a function called left join
- Arguments: two hash maps

> The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.

> The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.

> Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
